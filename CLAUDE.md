- Ollama API documentation is here and should be referenced during the project as needed: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md

### User Interface Design
- The streamlit sidebar at the top will have the following two selectbox. The first selectbox will allow the user to choose among the locally installed Ollama models. The second selectbox below will allow the user to choose a language. The primary languages for now will be French, German, Spanish, and Italian.
